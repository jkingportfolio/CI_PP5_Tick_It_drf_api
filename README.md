## User Stories

The back-end section of the project focuses on its administration side and covers one user story:
- As an admin, I want to be able to create, edit and delete users, tasks, packs, comments and watches, so that I can have control over the content of the application and also remove any potential inappropriate content.


## Database

The following models were created to represent the database model structure of the application:

## Validation

### Python Validation

PEP8 was unavailable at the time of creating this project so pycodestyle was used instead to continually check all Python code for errors and warnings.

## Testing

The following tests were carried out on the app:
1. Manual testing of user stories
2. Automated testing

### Manual testing of user stories

- As an admin, I want to be able to create, edit and delete the users, posts, comments and likes, so that I can have a control over the content of the application and remove any potential inappropriate content

**Test** | **Action** | **Expected Result** | **Actual Result**
-------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | -----------------
User | Create, update & delete user | A user can be created, edited or deleted | Works as expected
User | Change permissions | User permissions can be updated | Works as expected
Profile | Create, update & delete | User profile can be created, edited or deleted | Works as expected
Task | Create, update & delete | A Task can be created, edited or deleted | Works as expected
Comment | Create, update & delete | A comment can be created, edited or deleted | Works as expected
Watch | Create & delete |  A Watch relationship between a Task and a User can be created or deleted | Works as expected
Pack | Create & delete | A Pack can be created, edited or deleted | Works as expected

In addition, tasks, comments, packs and watches can be created by logged-in users only. Users can only update or delete the content which was created by themselves.
